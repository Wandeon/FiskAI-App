source_report,title,severity,owner,due_date,evidence,affected_invariants
accessibility-audit.md,Incorrect document language,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Root layout sets `<html lang=""en"">` (`src/app/layout.tsx:12-18`) even though the UI copy is Croatian (`Prijava`, `Novi E-Račun`, etc.). Screen readers will mispronounce labels. Set `lang=""hr""` (or make it dynamic per locale) to ensure proper pronunciation and spell checking.",None
accessibility-audit.md,Inputs lack ARIA metadata,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– `Input` component (`src/components/ui/input.tsx:8-22`) toggles border color for errors but never sets `aria-invalid`, nor links the helper text via `aria-describedby`. Keyboard/screen-reader users therefore do not know which fields are invalid. Add these attributes and ensure ids are unique so error text is announced.",None
accessibility-audit.md,Unlabeled select element,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– The buyer dropdown on the new invoice form (`src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/new/page.tsx:101-118`) renders `<label className=""text-sm font-medium"">` without `htmlFor`, and the `<select>` lacks an `id`, so assistive tech cannot map the label. Assign ids and connect labels to form controls.",None
accessibility-audit.md,Tables missing captions and scope,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– The invoices table (`src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/page.tsx:31-88`) lacks a `<caption>` describing the data and does not set `scope=""col""`/`scope=""row""`. This makes navigating rows/columns difficult for screen readers. Add a caption summarizing the table contents and scope attributes for headers.",None
accessibility-audit.md,Status indicators rely on color alone,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Dashboard status chips (e.g., PDV obveznik) use green/yellow icons only (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx:62-83`). Users with color-vision deficiencies cannot distinguish states. Include text labels (e.g., “PDV: Da/Ne”) and consider adding icons with distinct shapes or patterns.",None
accessibility-audit.md,No focus management or announcements after actions,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Forms such as login/register (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:37-85`) render inline error divs without `role=""alert""`/`aria-live`, so errors are not announced. Add live regions and move focus to the first invalid field on submit failure.",None
code-quality-architecture.md,Client pages import server actions directly,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– `src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/new/page.tsx:12-55` imports `getContacts` from the `""use server""` action module and calls it inside `useEffect`. This bypasses server-component data fetching patterns, couples the client bundle to server-only code, and makes error/loading states hard to manage. Replace with server-side data fetching (load contacts in the page’s async component and pass via props) or expose a typed API route/React Query hook.",None
code-quality-architecture.md,Money totals computed with floating-point math before persisting,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– `src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:24-49` multiplies JS numbers to derive `netAmount`, `vatAmount`, and `totalAmount`, then wraps them with `new Decimal(...)`. Floating-point accumulation can yield rounding errors for currency (e.g., 0.1+0.2). Use Prisma `Decimal` (or a helper) for all arithmetic to ensure exact cents throughout.",None
code-quality-architecture.md,Redundant auth/company lookups,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– In `src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/page.tsx:7-20` the page already runs `requireAuth`/`requireCompany`, but it then calls `getEInvoices()` (`src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:145-165`), which repeats the same checks, resulting in duplicate DB queries per request. Either accept a `companyId` parameter or move the query logic directly into the page component to avoid N+1 lookups and simplify tracing.",None
code-quality-architecture.md,Server actions return unstructured errors,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Actions such as `register`, `login`, `createCompany`, and `createEInvoice` (`src/app/actions/*.ts`) return `{ error: string }` without error codes or field metadata (except one schema flatten). This makes client UX inconsistent and hampers logging/observability. Introduce a shared result type (`{ ok: boolean; message; code; details }`) and centralize logging so both UI and telemetry stay consistent.",None
code-quality-architecture.md,No shared validation/masking utilities for repeated business fields,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– OIB, IBAN, phone, and VAT logic are replicated in multiple forms (`src/app/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/new/page.tsx`). Extract reusable input components with built-in formatting, validation hooks, and help text to reduce duplication and future bugs.",None
devex-ci-audit.md,No continuous integration,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Repository lacks any `.github/workflows` (or other CI config), so linting, type checks, Prisma migrations, and tests are never enforced before deployment. Introduce a pipeline (GitHub Actions or equivalent) that runs `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and database migrations on every PR/main push.",None
devex-ci-audit.md,Missing `.env.example` / secrets guidance,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– The repo includes `.env` and `.env.local` with real connection strings but no sanitized template for contributors. Provide a checked-in `.env.example` with placeholder values plus documentation on how to configure Coolify/production secrets, and keep sensitive files out of git.",None
devex-ci-audit.md,Dockerfile not optimized for target platform,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Production runs on ARM64 (per docs) yet `Dockerfile` starts from `FROM node:20-alpine` without `--platform=linux/arm64`. Builds performed on x86 may emit incompatible binaries. Pin the platform in each stage or use `node:20-alpine@sha256:...` multi-arch images, and document the expectation.",None
devex-ci-audit.md,Compose file doubles as production manifest,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– `docker-compose.yml:1-40` mixes local dev and prod concerns (hard-coded secrets, `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://erp.metrica.hr`). Maintain separate `docker-compose.dev.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml` (or .env overrides) so developers can run the stack safely without touching prod credentials.",None
devex-ci-audit.md,No task automation for Prisma,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– There is no script for `prisma migrate deploy`/`prisma db push` in `package.json`. Add npm scripts (e.g., `""db:migrate""`) and document migration flow to keep schema changes synchronized.",None
devex-ci-audit.md,Observability missing,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– There are no logging/monitoring hooks (no structured logger, no health metrics, no uptime checks). Instrument the app via middleware or integrate Coolify monitoring, and ensure logs are structured for ingestion.",None
domain-data-audit.md,Invoice numbers not unique per company,High,TBD,TBD,"– `prisma/schema.prisma:183-240` defines `invoiceNumber` with only a standalone index (`@@index([invoiceNumber])`). Two tenants could end up sharing the same number, and even within one company duplicate numbers are possible, leading to accounting/fiscalization errors. Add a composite constraint `@@unique([companyId, invoiceNumber])` to ensure numbering sequences remain unique per tenant.",None
domain-data-audit.md,Cross-tenant contact references allowed,High,TBD,TBD,"– `createEInvoice` (`src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:12-78`) accepts any `buyerId`/`sellerId` without verifying they belong to the caller’s company. Coupled with eager inclusion of `buyer` data in list/detail queries (`src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:152-182`), a malicious user can attach another tenant’s contact and expose their PII. Enforce ownership checks before writing (e.g., `await db.contact.findFirst({ where: { id: buyerId, companyId: company.id } })`) or add Prisma middleware to inject `companyId` conditions automatically.",None
domain-data-audit.md,No constraint on default company per user,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– `CompanyUser` (`prisma/schema.prisma:97-112`) tracks `isDefault` but nothing prevents multiple entries being true for the same user. Server logic (`src/app/actions/company.ts:137-145`) tries to reset flags before switching, yet concurrent requests can still yield two defaults. Add a partial unique index (Prisma: `@@unique([userId], map: ""unique_default_company"", where: isDefault = true)`) or enforce via database constraint to keep tenant routing deterministic.",None
domain-data-audit.md,Sensitive provider credentials stored in plaintext,High,TBD,TBD,"– Company settings store `eInvoiceApiKey` directly in the `Company` row (`prisma/schema.prisma:83-95`) and server action `updateCompanySettings` (`src/app/actions/company.ts:88-118`) writes the raw string. Beyond security concerns, this violates regulatory requirements for handling fiscalization keys. Introduce field-level encryption (e.g., libsodium) or move provider credentials into a dedicated secrets table with transparent encryption/decryption.",None
domain-data-audit.md,Contact data lacks per-company uniqueness,High,TBD,TBD,"– `Contact.oib` is indexed but not constrained per tenant (`prisma/schema.prisma:126-151`). A supplier entered by two colleagues could produce duplicates, breaking invoice validation. Add `@@unique([companyId, oib])` (with nullable handling) and provide deduplication logic in the UI.",None
domain-data-audit.md,Products & contacts unmanaged yet referenced,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– While Prisma models for `Product` and `Contact` exist, there are no API routes/UI for enforcing mandatory fields (e.g., VAT category, OIB). Until those modules ship, invoices can reference incomplete contacts, undermining compliance. Define minimum data requirements and validation flows before enabling outbound e-invoicing for production users.",None
performance-audit.md,Extra round-trips for contacts data,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– The new invoice page fetches contacts from the client bundle (`src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/new/page.tsx:12-55`). Every render triggers a server action call over the network, even though the page is an async server component that could preload contacts once during SSR. Move the query to the server side (or expose a paginated API) to avoid duplicate fetches and improve TTFB.",None
performance-audit.md,No pagination or limits on invoice queries,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– `getEInvoices` (`src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:145-165`) returns every invoice for a company with full relations. As data grows, responses will balloon and tank both DB and rendering performance. Introduce pagination (cursor/limit), expose filters in the UI, and default to, e.g., the last 50 records.",None
performance-audit.md,Loading unused relations,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– The list view only needs buyer name, totals, and status, yet `getEInvoices` includes `seller` and every `line` (`src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:158-162`). Pulling all child rows on every list request increases query time and JSON size. Use `select` to fetch only the fields needed for each screen, and lazily load line items when opening an invoice detail.",None
performance-audit.md,Duplicated authentication queries,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Pages such as `src/app/(dashboard)/e-invoices/page.tsx` already resolve `requireAuth`/`requireCompany`, but calling `getEInvoices()` performs the same checks again (`src/app/actions/e-invoice.ts:145-165`). This results in two DB hits and two session validations per request. Refactor helpers to accept the resolved `companyId` to cut redundant work.",None
performance-audit.md,Build image misses production dependency pruning,Medium,TBD,TBD,"– Dockerfile copies the entire `node_modules` directory from the build stage into the runner (`Dockerfile:14-48`) without running `npm prune --production` or using `npm ci --omit=dev`, so the final image ships devDependencies and wastes memory. Prune dev packages before copying to the runtime layer to shrink startup footprint.",None
security-audit.md,Hard-coded production secrets committed to git,High,TBD,TBD,"`docker-compose.yml` embeds live Postgres credentials and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (lines 6-33). Anyone with repo access gets DB user/pass and JWT secret, enabling database compromise and forging Auth.js sessions. **Remediation:** Move all secrets to environment/secret management (Coolify, host env, etc.), remove from git, and rotate every leaked credential immediately.",None
security-audit.md,Host header poisoning via `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`,High,TBD,TBD,"Compose file sets `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` while exposing the container on `0.0.0.0:3002`. Auth.js will trust arbitrary `Host` headers, so direct hits to the VPS IP can forge callbacks/cookies for attacker domains → account takeover/open redirects. **Remediation:** Drop the flag and rely on `NEXTAUTH_URL`, or restrict network so only Cloudflare/front proxy can reach the app.",None
security-audit.md,Provider API keys stored/returned in plaintext,High,TBD,TBD,"`Company.eInvoiceApiKey` is plain string storage (schema lines 84-85) and `updateCompanySettings` writes raw data without encryption or access scoping. Brokers/DB readers can steal e-invoice provider keys and submit invoices on behalf of clients. **Remediation:** Encrypt at rest (KMS/lib­sodium), never echo the raw key back, and rotate any existing keys.",None
security-audit.md,Cross-tenant contact disclosure in e-invoice creation,High,TBD,TBD,`createEInvoice` trusts `buyerId` from the client without checking tenant ownership; later `getEInvoices`/`getEInvoice` eagerly include the buyer relation. Attackers can reference another company’s contact ID to view their full PII. **Remediation:** Verify `buyerId`/`sellerId` belong to the caller’s company prior to create/update and add Prisma-level constraints/middleware enforcing `companyId` filters across relations.,None
ui-ux-audit.md,Company context missing:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Header only shows the logged-in email (`src/components/layout/header.tsx:16-24`), so users juggling multiple companies cannot tell which tenant is active nor switch it. Add a prominent company switcher (with search) plus status badges (e.g., onboarding complete, provider connected).",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Action feedback:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"No global toast system, meaning server-action successes/errors (e.g., save contact, send invoice) rely on inline form state. Introduce a non-blocking notification layer so every action provides immediate confirmation and nudge toward the next logical step.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Navigation depth:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Sidebar (`src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx:7-34`) advertises Contacts/Products/Settings but there are no implemented routes yet. Until modules exist, hide or disable the links to avoid dead ends; when enabled, indicate unread items/tasks counts.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Responsive behavior:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Shell is desktop-focused (fixed `w-64` sidebar, static header). Implement collapsible navigation for tablets/phones and keep primary CTAs accessible via floating action buttons (FAB) on smaller devices.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Missing recovery path:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Login form stops at email/password (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:37-78`); there is no “Forgot password?”, passwordless option, or contact support link. Add recovery CTA beneath the password field and surface help text when Auth errors occur repeatedly.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,SSO discoverability:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Google provider is configured server-side, yet no button appears in the UI. Show branded OAuth buttons alongside the native form to shorten onboarding for busy founders.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Context & trust:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Provide short marketing copy (security badges, privacy note, support contact) inside the card so new accountants feel safe entering credentials.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Registration guardrails:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Register form lacks password strength meter or inline explanation of the policy defined in `registerSchema` (`src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx:79-100`). Display the rules upfront, validate in real time, and require acceptance of terms/GDPR consent before submission.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Single long form without progress:,Medium,TBD,TBD,The onboarding screen is a blank form (`src/app/(dashboard)/onboarding/page.tsx:44-152`) that does not explain why data is needed. Split into a progressive 3-step wizard (Company basics → Tax info → Communication + preview) with a progress bar and autosave.,None
ui-ux-audit.md,No contextual helpers:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Fields such as OIB, VAT payer, IBAN provide no helper text or validation on blur. Add inline tooltips (e.g., “OIB must be 11 digits; we’ll verify checksum automatically”), masked inputs, and prefill ISO country code.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Lack of next-step guidance:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"After submission the user is redirected silently to `/dashboard`. Show a confirmation screen summarizing the new company, highlighting next tasks (“Add your first contact”, “Connect e-invoice provider”).",None

ui-ux-audit.md,Limited insight:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Dashboard only displays two counts and the OIB (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx:27-60`). Expand into cards that answer “What requires my attention right now?”: drafts awaiting send, invoices overdue, contacts missing OIB, setup checklists.",None
ui-ux-audit.md,Action shortcuts:,Medium,TBD,TBD,"Provide CTA buttons on cards (e.g., “Create invoice”, “Add contact”) and show provider connection status with direct links to configure missing items (`company.eInvoiceProvider` data at lines 62-83).",None
